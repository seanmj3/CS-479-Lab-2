#CS-479-Lab-2: Chest Wearable Device Project
This project focuses on developing a chest-wearable device capable of monitoring breathing and ECG (Electrocardiogram) rates. The device utilizes sensors to measure the resistance from the chest during breathing.

Overview
The primary goal of this project is to create a wearable device that offers real-time monitoring of breathing and ECG rates. By leveraging sensor technology, the device will accurately calculate the chest's resistance caused by breathing movements.

Features
Real-time monitoring of breathing rates
Real-time monitoring of ECG rates
Utilizes sensors for precise measurements
Lightweight and portable design for comfortable wear
Usage
Hardware Setup: Connect the sensors to the designated ports on the device.
Power On: Turn on the device and ensure proper initialization.
Wear the Device: Position the device securely on the chest.
Monitoring: View the breathing and ECG rates displayed on the device or connected interface.
