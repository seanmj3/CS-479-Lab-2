# CS-479-Lab-2

This project focuses on developing a chest-wearable device capable of monitoring breathing and ECG (Electrocardiogram) rates. The device utilizes sensors to measure the resistance from the chest during breathing movements.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to create a wearable device that offers real-time monitoring of breathing and ECG rates. By leveraging sensor technology, the device will accurately calculate the chest's resistance caused by breathing movements.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of breathing rates
- Real-time monitoring of ECG rates
- Utilizes sensors for precise measurements
- Lightweight and portable design for comfortable wear

## Usage

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the sensors to the designated ports on the device.
2. **Power On**: Turn on the device and ensure proper initialization.
3. **Wear the Device**: Position the device securely on the chest.
4. **Monitoring**: View the breathing and ECG rates displayed on the device or connected interface.

## Installation
